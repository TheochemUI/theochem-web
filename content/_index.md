        <span style="color: #808080; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">Science Institute and Faculty of Physical Sciences of the University of Iceland </span>
        
        <span style="font-size: 20px;"> The Theochem lab at the University of Iceland is dedicated to advancing the theory and methodology of atomic-scale modelling. We develop and
        apply innovative computational techniques, including methods for calculating reaction pathways and rates, density functional based 
        approaches for ground and excited electronic states, multiscale approaches for condensed-phase systems, and ultrafast and long-timescale 
        molecular dynamics simulation strategies. The areas of application range from surface catalytic processes, such as CO<sub>2</sub> electrochemical 
        reduction, to light-induced processes in photoactive molecular and condensed-phase systems for solar energy conversion. </span> 
        
        <span style="font-size: 24px;"> The Theochem lab includes the following research groups: </span>
