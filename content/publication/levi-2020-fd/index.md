abstract: A direct optimization method for obtaining excited electronic states using
  density functionals is presented. It involves selective convergence on saddle points
  on the energy surface representing the variation of the energy as a function of
  the electronic degrees of freedom, thereby avoiding convergence to a minimum and
  corresponding variational collapse to the ground electronic state. The method is
  based on an exponential transformation of the molecular orbitals, making it possible
  to use efficient quasi-Newton optimization approaches. Direct convergence on a target
  nth-order saddle point is guided by an appropriate preconditioner for the optimization
  as well as the maximum overlap method. Results of benchmark calculations of 52 excited
  states of molecules indicate that the method is more robust than a standard self-consistent
  field (SCF) approach especially when degenerate or quasi-degenerate orbitals are
  involved. The method can overcome challenges arising from rearrangement of closely
  spaced orbitals in a charge-transfer excitation of the nitrobenzene molecule, a
  case where the SCF fails to converge. The formulation of the method is general and
  can be applied to non-unitary invariant functionals, such as self-interaction corrected
  functionals.
