 abstract = {Variational calculations of excited electronic states are carried out by finding saddle points on the surface that describes how the energy of the system varies as a function of the electronic degrees of freedom. This approach has several advantages over commonly used methods especially in the context of density functional calculations, as collapse to the ground state is avoided and yet, the orbitals are variationally optimized for the excited state. This optimization makes it possible to describe excitations with large charge transfer where calculations based on ground state orbitals are problematic, as in linear response time-dependent density functional theory. A generalized mode following method is presented where an $n^\textth$-order saddle point is found by inverting the components of the gradient in the direction of the eigenvectors of the $n$ lowest eigenvalues of the electronic Hessian matrix. This approach has the distinct advantage of following a chosen excited state through atomic configurations where the symmetry of the single determinant wave function is broken, as demonstrated in calculations of potential energy curves for nuclear motion in the ethylene and dihydrogen molecules. The method is implemented using a generalized Davidson algorithm and an exponential transformation for updating the orbitals within a generalized gradient approximation of the energy functional. Convergence is found to be more robust than for a direct optimization approach previously shown to outperform standard self-consistent field approaches, as illustrated here for charge transfer excitations in nitrobenzene and N-phenylpyrrole, involving calculations of $4^\textth$- and $6^\textth$-order saddle points, respectively. Finally, calculations of a diplatinum and silver complex are presented, illustrating the applicability of the method to excited state energy curves of large molecules.},
