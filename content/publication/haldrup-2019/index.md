abstract: We report x-ray free electron laser experiments addressing ground-state
  structural dynamics of the diplatinum anion Pt2POP4 following photoexcitation. The
  structural dynamics are tracked with <100  fs time resolution by x-ray scattering,
  utilizing the anisotropic component to suppress contributions from the bulk solvent.
  The x-ray data exhibit a strong oscillatory component with period 0.28 ps and decay
  time 2.2 ps, and structural analysis of the difference signal directly shows this
  as arising from ground-state dynamics along the PtPt coordinate. These results are
  compared with multiscale Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations and demonstrate
  how off-resonance excitation can be used to prepare a vibrationally cold excited-state
  population complemented by a structure-dependent depletion of the ground-state population
  which subsequently evolves in time, allowing direct tracking of ground-state structural
  dynamics.
