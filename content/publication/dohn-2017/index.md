abstract: A multiscale density functional theory–quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics
  (DFT-QM/MM) scheme is presented, based on an efficient electrostatic coupling between
  the electronic density obtained from a grid-based projector augmented wave (GPAW)
  implementation of density functional theory and a classical potential energy function.
  The scheme is implemented in a general fashion and can be used with various choices
  for the descriptions of the QM or MM regions. Tests on H2O clusters, ranging from
  dimer to decamer show that no systematic energy errors are introduced by the coupling
  that exceeds the differences in the QM and MM descriptions. Over 1 ns of liquid
  water, Born–Oppenheimer QM/MM molecular dynamics (MD) are sampled combining 10 parallel
  simulations, showing consistent liquid water structure over the QM/MM border. The
  method is applied in extensive parallel MD simulations of an aqueous solution of
  the diplatinum [Pt2(P2O5H2)4]4– complex (PtPOP), spanning a total time period of
  roughly half a nanosecond. An average Pt–Pt distance deviating only 0.01 Å from
  experimental results, and a ground-state Pt–Pt oscillation frequency deviating by
  <2% from experimental results were obtained. The simulations highlight a remarkable
  harmonicity of the Pt–Pt oscillation, while also showing clear signs of Pt–H hydrogen
  bonding and directional coordination of water molecules along the Pt–Pt axis of
  the complex.
