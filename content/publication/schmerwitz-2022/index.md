abstract: Theoretical studies of photochemical processes require a description of
  the energy surfaces of excited electronic states, especially near degeneracies,
  where transitions between states are most likely. Systems relevant to photochemical
  applications are typically too large for high-level multireference methods, and
  while time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is efficient, it can fail
  to provide the required accuracy. A variational, time- independent density functional
  approach is applied to the twisting of the double bond and pyramidal distortion
  in ethylene, the quintessential model for photochemical studies. By allowing for
  symmetry breaking, the calculated energy surfaces exhibit the correct topology around
  the twisted-pyramidalized conical intersection even when using a semilocal functional
  approximation, and by including explicit self-interaction correction, the torsional
  energy curves are in close agreement with published multireference results. The
  findings of the present work point to the possibility of using a single determinant
  time-independent density functional approach to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics,
  even for large systems where multireference methods are impractical and TDDFT is
  often not accurate enough.
