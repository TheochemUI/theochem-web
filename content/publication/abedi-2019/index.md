abstract: In this work, we investigate the excited-state solute and solvation structure
  of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, [Fe(bpy)3]2+, [Fe(bmip)2]2+ and [Cu(phen)2]+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine;
  bmip = 2,6-bis(3-methyl-imidazole-1-ylidine)-pyridine; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline)
  transition metal complexes (TMCs) in terms of solute–solvent radial distribution
  functions (RDFs) and evaluate the performance of some of the most popular partial
  atomic charge (PAC) methods for obtaining these RDFs by molecular dynamics (MD)
  simulations. To this end, we compare classical MD of a frozen solute in water and
  acetonitrile (ACN) with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics Born–Oppenheimer molecular
  dynamics (QM/MM BOMD) simulations. The calculated RDFs show that the choice of a
  suitable PAC method is dependent on the coordination number of the metal, denticity
  of the ligands, and type of solvent. It is found that this selection is less sensitive
  for water than ACN. Furthermore, a careful choice of the PAC method should be considered
  for TMCs that exhibit a free direct coordination site, such as [Cu(phen)2]+. The
  results of this work show that fast classical MD simulations with ChelpG/RESP or
  CM5 PACs can produce RDFs close to those obtained by QM/MM MD and thus, provide
  reliable solvation structures of TMCs to be used, e.g. in the analysis of scattering
  data.
