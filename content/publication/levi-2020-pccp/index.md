abstract: Copper(I) bis-phenanthroline complexes represent Earth-abundant alternatives
  to ruthenium-based sensitizers for solar energy conversion and photocatalysis. Improved
  understanding of the solvent- mediated excited-state structural dynamics can help
  optimize their photoconversion efficiency. Through direct dynamics simulations in
  acetonitrile and excited-state minimum energy path calculations in vacuum, we uncover
  the mechanism of the photoinduced flattening motion of the prototypical system [Cu(dmphen)2]+
  (dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline). We find that the ligand distortion
  is a two-step process in acetonitrile. The fast component (B110 fs) is due to spontaneous
  pseudo Jahn– Teller instability and is largely solvent independent, while the slow
  component (B1.2 ps) arises from the mutual interplay between solvent molecules closely
  approaching the metal center and rotation of the methyl substituents. These results
  shed new light on the influence of a donor solvent such as acetonitrile and methyl
  substituents on the flattening dynamics of [Cu(dmphen)2]+.
