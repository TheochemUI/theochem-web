abstract: Density functional calculations of Rydberg excited states up to high energy
  are carried out for several molecules using an approach where the orbitals are variationally
  optimized by converging on saddle points on the electronic energy surface within
  a real space grid representation. Remarkably good agreement with experimental estimates
  of the excitation energy is obtained using the generalized gradient approximation
  (GGA) functional of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) when Perdew-Zunger self-interaction
  correction is applied in combination with complex-valued orbitals. Even without
  the correction, the PBE functional gives quite good results despite the fact that
  corresponding Rydberg virtual orbitals have positive energy in the ground state
  calculation. Results obtained using the TPSS and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals are
  also presented, but they do not provide a systematic improvement over the results
  from the uncorrected PBE functional. The grid representation combined with the projector
  augmented-wave approach gives a simpler and better representation of the diffuse
  Rydberg orbitals than a linear combination of atomic orbitals with commonly used
  basis sets, the latter leading to an overestimation of the excitation energy due
  to confinement of the excited states.
