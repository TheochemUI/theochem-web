abstract: Elucidation of the mechanism for optical spin initialization of point defects
  in solids in the context of quantum applications requires an accurate description
  of the excited electronic states involved. While variational density functional
  calculations have been successful in describing the ground state of a great variety
  of systems, doubts have been expressed in the literature regarding the ability of
  such calculations to describe electronic excitations of point defects. A direct
  orbital optimization method is used here to perform time-independent, variational
  density functional calculations of a prototypical defect, the negatively charged
  nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. The calculations include up to 512 atoms subject
  to periodic boundary conditions and the excited state calculations require similar
  computational effort as ground state calculations. Contrary to some previous reports,
  the use of local and semi-local density functionals gives the correct ordering of
  the low-lying triplet and singlet states, namely 3A2 < 1E < 1A1 < 3E. Furthermore,
  the more advanced meta generalized gradient approximation functionals give results
  that are in remarkably good agreement with high-level, many-body calculations as
  well as available experimental estimates, even for the excited singlet state which
  is often referred to as having multireference character. The lowering of the energy
  in the triplet excited state as the atom coordinates are optimized in accordance
  with analytical forces is also close to the experimental estimate and the resulting
  zero-phonon line triplet excitation energy is underestimated by only 0.15 eV. The
  approach used here is found to be a promising tool for studying electronic excitations
  of point defects in, for example, systems relevant for quantum technologies.
