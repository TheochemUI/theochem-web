abstract: 'Understanding how the structure of carbonaceous materials changes upon
  oxidation at mild temperature as a function of the graphitic order is of great importance
  for the development of clean combustion technologies, such as carbon fuel cells.
  The micro- and nanostructures of a range of carbon materials at room temperature
  and upon mild oxidation at 300 °C have been analysed by means of mercury porosimetry,
  Nitrogen adsorption, X-Ray Diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and Electron Paramagnetic
  Resonance. The samples included carbons with increasing level of graphitic order:
  three chars derived from two bituminous coals and a lignite, a synthetic carbon
  and a graphitized coke. The experimental characterization allows to classify the
  materials according to different structural parameters, including porosity, surface
  area, degree of graphitization and paramagnetic activation of the carbonaceous surface.
  A correlation with the rank of the analysed materials is observed. For the graphitized
  coke, oxidation leads to more crystalline order and enhancement of the paramagnetic
  signal. A similar increase in the paramagnetic activity is observed for the Lignite
  char. On the other hand, for the higher rank, bituminous and synthetic chars, mild
  oxidation leads to a slight expansion of the amorphous carbon and loss of paramagnetic
  activity. The differences are rationalized in terms of formation of new carbon-oxygen
  complexes on the graphitized coke and on the Lignite char, and redistribution of
  already existing complexes for the higher-rank coals. This investigation complements
  previous X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements.'
