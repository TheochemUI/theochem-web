abstract: Photochemical reactions in solution are governed by a complex interplay
  between transient intramolecular electronic and nuclear structural changes and accompanying
  solvent rearrangements. State-of-the-art time-resolved X-ray solution scattering
  has emerged in the last decade as a powerful technique to observe solute and solvent
  motions in real time. However, disentangling solute and solvent dynamics and how
  they mutually influence each other remains challenging. Here, we simultaneously
  measure femtosecond X-ray emission and scattering to track both the intramolecular
  and solvation structural dynamics following photoexcitation of a solvated copper
  photosensitizer. Quantitative analysis assisted by molecular dynamics simulations
  reveals a two-step ligand flattening strongly coupled to the solvent reorganization,
  which conventional optical methods could not discern. First, a ballistic flattening
  triggers coherent motions of surrounding acetonitrile molecules. In turn, the approach
  of acetonitrile molecules to the copper atom mediates the decay of intramolecular
  coherent vibrations and induces a further ligand flattening. These direct structural
  insights reveal that photoinduced solute and solvent motions can be intimately intertwined,
  explaining how the key initial steps of light harvesting are affected by the solvent
  on the atomic time and length scale. Ultimately, this work takes a step forward
  in understanding the microscopic mechanisms of the bidirectional influence between
  transient solvent reorganization and photoinduced solute structural dynamics.
