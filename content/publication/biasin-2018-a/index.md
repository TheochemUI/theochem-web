abstract: Time-resolved X-ray scattering patterns from photoexcited molecules in solution
  are in many cases anisotropic at the ultrafast time scales accessible at X-ray free-electron
  lasers (XFELs). This anisotropy arises from the interaction of a linearly polarized
  UV–Vis pump laser pulse with the sample, which induces anisotropic structural changes
  that can be captured by femtosecond X-ray pulses. In this work, a method for quantitative
  analysis of the anisotropic scattering signal arising from an ensemble of molecules
  is described, and it is demonstrated how its use can enhance the structural sensitivity
  of the time-resolved X-ray scattering experiment. This method is applied on time-resolved
  X-ray scattering patterns measured upon photoexcitation of a solvated di-platinum
  complex at an XFEL, and the key parameters involved are explored. It is shown that
  a combined analysis of the anisotropic and isotropic difference scattering signals
  in this experiment allows a more precise determination of the main photoinduced
  structural change in the solute, i.e. the change in Pt—Pt bond length, and yields
  more information on the excitation channels than the analysis of the isotropic scattering
  only. Finally, it is discussed how the anisotropic transient response of the solvent
  can enable the determination of key experimental parameters such as the instrument
  response function.
