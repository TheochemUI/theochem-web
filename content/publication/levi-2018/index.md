abstract: Recent ultrafast experiments have unveiled the time scales of vibrational
  cooling and decoherence upon photoexcitation of the diplatinum complex [Pt2(P2O5H2)4]4–
  in solvents. Here, we contribute to the understanding of the structure and dynamics
  of the lowest lying singlet excited state of the model photocatalyst by performing
  potential energy surface calculations and Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations
  in the gas phase and in water. Solvent effects were treated using a multiscale quantum
  mechanics/molecular mechanics approach. Fast sampling was achieved with a modified
  version of delta self-consistent field implemented in the grid-based projector-augmented
  wave density functional theory code. The known structural parameters and the PESs
  of the first singlet and triplet excited states are correctly reproduced. Besides,
  the simulations deliver clear evidence that pseudorotation of the ligands in the
  excited state leads to symmetry lowering of the Pt2P8 core. Coherence decay of Pt–Pt
  stretching vibrations in solution was found to be governed by vibrational cooling,
  which is in agreement with previous ultrafast experiments. We also show that the
  flow of excess Pt–Pt vibrational energy is first directed toward vibrational modes
  involving the ligands, with the solvent favoring intramolecular vibrational energy
  redistribution. The results are supported by thorough vibrational analysis in terms
  of generalized normal modes.
