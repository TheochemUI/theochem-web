 abstract = {Density functional calculations of Rydberg excited states up to high energy are carried out for several molecules using an approach where the orbitals are variationally optimized by converging on saddle points on the electronic energy surface within a real space grid representation. Remarkably good agreement with experimental estimates of the excitation energy is obtained using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) when Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction is applied in combination with complex-valued orbitals. Even without the correction, the PBE functional gives quite good results despite the fact that corresponding Rydberg virtual orbitals have positive energy in the ground state calculation. Results obtained using the TPSS and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals are also presented, but they do not provide a systematic improvement over the results from the uncorrected PBE functional. The grid representation combined with the projector augmented-wave approach gives a simpler and better representation of the diffuse Rydberg orbitals than a linear combination of atomic orbitals with commonly used basis sets, the latter leading to an overestimation of the excitation energy due to confinement of the excited states.},
